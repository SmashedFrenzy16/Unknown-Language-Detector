# Unknown Language Detector

Happy New Year 2023! As this is my first repository of the year and New Year's is a global celebration, I have decided to make this so that you can understand a lot of people around the world when they are texting you!

## Description

Don't know a language that someone is talking to you in? Then this set of programs is for you!

## Requirements

- `langdetect` module:
  
  ```
  pip install langdetect
  ```
  
- `textblob` module:
  
  ```
  pip install textblob
  ```
  
- `langid` module:
  
  ```
  pip install langid
  ```

## Which One Do I Use?

- `langdetect` is a port of Googleâ€™s language-detection library that supports 55 languages. It is best used for more common languages that are spoken.
